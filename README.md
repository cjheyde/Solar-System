# Solar System Project 🪐

This Project shows the Solar System Planets and cards with information of missions sent from Earth to explore the other planets.

<strong>First commit:</strong> on Apr 6th, 2022.

Here I had to exercise: the usage of JSX in React, create class components in React, use props correctly and use PropTypes, as well as HTML and CSS.

This was my first front-end JavaScript Project, as part of my school [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) requirements to move forward.
